# Neuronal network for Braille symbol detection

As part of the machine learning course, a neural network is developed and trained to identify Braille symbols from photographs.

For this, two models are trained. The first model classifies an input image into one of the 26 possible Braille characters. The second model classifies the image into one of the 6 base patterns that form these characters through a linear combination.
